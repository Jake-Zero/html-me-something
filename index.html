                <p>This is a group of individual YouTubers who play multiplayer games together with the occasional guest or guests. The main three are Chuggaconroy, Proton Jon and NintendoCaprisun. They'll also occasionally do single player games that one player doesn't know very well (usually Chuggaconroy) and the other two know by heart. Their main playthroughs are of Mario Party games. Chuggaconroy was Donkey Kong in Mario Party 1-4, Daisy in 5-6, and Toad starting from 7. Proton Jon played Mario until 3 where he consistently played as Waluigi. NintendoCaprisun has played as Yoshi all throughout the Mario Party games and considering the green dinosaur hasn't been out of the picture since the first Mario Party, it's doubtful that that'll change anytime soon.</p>

                <p>Chuggaconroy is a let's player who does walkthroughs of games he likes very much. He's also very naive on certain innuendos, not knowing what they mean. If only he had a certain book that could tell him what those innuendos meant. Regardless, you should not wear headphones when watching him because he tends to get VERY LOUD when he gets excited. His walkthroughs, nevertheless, are very descriptive and detailed.</p>

                <p>ProtonJon is a variety streamer on Twitch. He generally streams on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. On Wednesday and Friday, he generally streams whatever he or his followers on Twitter want to. On Mondays, he usually does Game Clearing, which he's not going to clear his stretch goal of A-Z this year. His recently cleared game was Resident Evil: Director's Cut before he left for his bi-yearly TRG recording. Saturdays, though, are his bread and butter: Fortune Cookie Streams. He starts the stream with whatever game he feels like playing at the time for 30 minutes at least, then he puts up a cookie where he pulls 5 games from his ginormous collection of games, RPG and tactics games excluded, with few exceptions, and his audience votes on what he should play next. If he has co-comms with him, they get a choice as well. He will then put a timer for 1:30 to determine what gets played next. If the game in the lead is very far ahead of the pack, he will declare it a Mercy Kill and that game will automatically be played next. If it's a co-comm game that wins, they can't pick a game next round. If a game in 2nd place is 1% behind the game in the lead before the timer goes off, that game will automatically be put into the next round of cookie. Before going to the next game, he'll go to Intermission, where he will read out subscriptions, give out created eggs to said subs, and read donations. Afterwards, he'll look at art in what he calls "Art Block". These streams are my particular favorite for the kind of shit people are willing to put Jon through, either through art or games.</p>

                <p>The oldest member of TRG. While I don't watch him as often as ProtonJon or Chuggaconroy, he also does variety playthroughs on both YouTube and Twitch. His humor is literal toilet humor.</p>

                <p>Continuing the trend of variety let's players, we have Tom Fawkes. He does Let's Plays of games he enjoys very well or recently released. On top of that, he's also an animator, mainly for TRG. He is exceptionally gifted for voice impressions, though his female voices leave a lot to be desired. Plus, he has a voice modulator to delay or otherwise adjust his voice. Just be careful it doesn't CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-</p>

                <p>On the female side of variety YouTubers, we have Masae Anela, or Masae for short. She plays games that she's enjoyed in her past. She's also an aspiring artist, as she also draws a lot of art. Her chibi forms, as shown in the image above, usually reflect what game she's currently playing. She pops up every now and then for information Masae either skipped out on or misremembered. She's also something of a shy singer, thinking that her singing is bad, even though it's very beautiful, as fitting her name. Like Tom, Masae also is good at imitating voices, though because her voice can't go very deep, her impressions of males tend to sound less masculine than they intend to be.</p>
