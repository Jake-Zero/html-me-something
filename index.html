                <p>This is a group of individual YouTubers who play multiplayer games together with the occasional guest or guests. The main three are Chuggaconroy, Proton Jon and NintendoCaprisun. They'll also occasionally do single player games that one player doesn't know very well (usually Chuggaconroy) and the other two know by heart. Their main playthroughs are of Mario Party games. Chuggaconroy was Donkey Kong in Mario Party 1-4, Daisy in 5-6, and Toad starting from 7. Proton Jon played Mario until 3 where he consistently played as Waluigi. NintendoCaprisun has played as Yoshi all throughout the Mario Party games and considering the green dinosaur hasn't been out of the picture since the first Mario Party, it's doubtful that that'll change anytime soon.</p>
